# Deep Speaker from Baidu Research -  Pytorch Implementation 

This is a slightly modified pytorch implementation of the model(modified Resnet + triplet loss) presented by Baidu Research in [Deep Speaker: an End-to-End Neural Speaker Embedding System](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.02304.pdf).

This code was tested using Voxceleb database. [Voxceleb database paper](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/publications/2017/Nagrani17/nagrani17.pdf) shows shows 7.8% EER using CNN. But in my code can't reach that point.
